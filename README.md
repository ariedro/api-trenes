# SOFSE Trains Obscurated API Bypasser

This project aims to make public access of SOFSE's Trains API, bypassing the security through obscurity of the internal API.

All the endpoints and params are the same of the original service, this is just a proxy that makes the authentication process available for public usage.

## Public instances

- [ariedro.dev](https://ariedro.dev/api-trenes)

## Endpoints

```js
// TODO
```

## Install

Just install and start

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```
